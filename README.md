# spotify-analysis
In its current state, this repo reads in Spotify streaming history as flat JSON files, concatenates the relevant files into one JSON, then converts it into a CSV for further SQL-based analysis.

It accepts my personal streaming history and a friend's streaming history, which are inputted as arguments.
